Cyber is a role-playing game about the exploration of a dark world of the near future, dominated by megacorporations and technology. Players take on the role of inhabitants of a giant metropolis - a crowded, noisy city full of greed, hypocrisy and shady dealings.
Characters can climb the career ladder of *zaibatsu*, operate on the edge of the law as freelancers for hire, or lead a settled (albeit not unchallenged) life as a member of one of thousands of factions - from religious sects to the city's emergency services.

It is based on the [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/).

## Introduction

**Cyber** was written with the following design philosophies in mind (inherited straight from Cairn):

- **Neutrality**: The referee’s role is to portray the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.
- **Classless**: A character’s role or skills are not limited by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry, cybermods they own and their experiences define their specialty.
- **Death**: Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is never random or without warning.
- **Fiction First**: Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the referee in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.
- **Growth**: Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.
- **Player Choice**: Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they’ve made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.
- **Shared Objectives**: Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Character Creation

### Name, Background, Wealth

Choose a name for your character and their [background](./background.md), which informs about knowledge and skills from the character's life experience.

Roll **1d4** and multiply by **1000** - it is the initial amount of credits your character has. These can be used to purchase starter equipment (see [Inventory](#inventory) and [Economy](#economy)).

### Ability scores

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

- **Biology (BIO)** - overall physical qualities: build, endurance, agility, dexterity, reflexes
- **Psyche (PSY)** - a set of mental and social qualities: intelligence, knowledge, willpower, empathy, contacts
- **Interface (INF)** - characteristics related to the use of technology: ability to operate in the Infosphere, resistance to cyber attack, level of integration with cybermodifications.

When creating a PC, the player should roll **3d6** for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap **any two** of the results.

> **Example:**
> Miko rolls for her character’s BIO, resulting in a 2, a 4, and a 6, totaling 12. The next two ability rolls result in a 9 for PSY and a 13 for INF. She decides to swap the 12 and the 9, for a character with 9 BIO, 12 PSY and 13 INF.

### Hit Protection

Roll **1d6** to determine your PC’s starting **Hit Protection (HP)**, which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**).

### Inventory

Characters have a total of **4 inventory slots**, with each slot describing a specific location:

- 2 slots for **hands**, i.e. whatever the hero is currently holding - weapons, tools, etc.
- 2 slots for **body** - any place such as the back, belt, chest. They can be used to attach another container such as a backpack or a bag.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the referee’s discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

Bags, backpacks, trolleys can increase the number of inventory slots, the same also applies to cybermodifications. Whereby, items representing containers attached to the character's body or requiring the use of the hand (carried, pulled) **take up one space** in the inventory.

> Example:
> John takes a backpack into action, which increases the number of slots by 4. However, the backpack has to be worn on the back, so it takes up one place. In the end, therefore, John has increased the number of slots by 3. If he had opted for a trolley, which he has to pull with one hand, the item still takes up one slot. With a transport vehicle, automatic trolley, etc., the containers do not take up any slot.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e. filling **all available** slots) is reduced to **0 HP**.

In addition to the starter equipment (purchased with initial credits), during character creation, each player can choose **up to 2 cyber modifications for free**, but the cost of these upgrades cannot exceed `20,000 ℂ`.

## Rules

### Abilities

Each of the three abilities are used in different circumstances (see  [Saves](#saves)).

- **Biology (BIO)** - in risky situations requiring physical strength, agility or stamina.
- **Psyche (PSY)** - for troubles that can be avoided through intelligence, knowledge, willpower or social interaction.
- **Interface (INF)** - in avoiding Infosphere threats, problems with cybermodifications or device control.

### Deprivation & Fatigue

A PC deprived of a crucial need (such as food or rest) or subjected to prolonged psychological pressure **is unable to recover HP or ability scores**.

Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day - starting with the empty slots and then marking the places occupied by the objects. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night’s rest in a safe spot). After a rest, the character recovers *all* taken slots.

Slots blocked by Fatigue cannot be used to carry equipment, if a player has to mark Fatigue on a slot already occupied by an item, that item must be put back or discarded. Any character who has **full inventory** (items and fatigue combined) is reduced to **0 HP**.

PCs can also gain Fatigue through events in the fiction or as an effect of certain actions (e.g. activation of some cybermodifications).

**Stimulants**: it is possible to get rid of Fatigue by taking stimulants. To do so, the player consumes one dose of stimulant and rolls the **1d4**. The result indicates the number of spaces recovered in the inventory (by removing Fatigue).

### Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a **1d20** for an appropriate ability score. If they roll **equal to or under** that ability score, they **pass**. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

Basically only this one type of test is performed in *Cyber* - we check whether the character has managed to avoid the threat or risk. Whereby, if a risk situation has two active sides, **the throw is performed by the one** for which we determine the risk to be **greater**.

You could put it this way:

- if a character performs a risky activity that does not involve other characters (climbing, breaking down a door, hacking an Infosphere node) - a passed test removes the risk of failure
- if (outside of combat) a character performs an action that is actively opposed by another character (PC or NPC) - a save eliminates the risk of an opponent interfering with the objective.

> Examples:
>
> Ada tries to open the electronic lock without knowing the code so she performs an INF test. A passed test means that she has successfully tricked the system and the door opens.

> Kumiko races against a security vehicle that tries to block her path. The vehicle's manoeuvres depend on her reflexes and agility so she has to perform a BIO test. Passing the test means she will be able to escape the security.

> Robert is trying to find a missing family member, and to do so he enlists the help of a street gang friend. A passing PSY test means that he has obtained some information about the wanted man.

### Easy and Difficult Tests

Sometimes the referee would like to point out that it is easier or more difficult for a character to avoid risks or negative consequences of actions (other than combat) due to <u>external circumstances</u>, independent of the character's abilities.

The referee may describe the test as **Easy** or **Difficult**.

- for the **Easy** test, the player rolls **2d20** and then chooses the **lowest** result.
- for the **Difficult** test, the player rolls **2d20** and then chooses the **highest** result.

### Combat

#### Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of turns.

#### Actions

On their turn, a character may **move up to 40ft** and take up to **one action**. This may be activating a cybermod, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the referee calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs. All actions, attacks and movements take place simultaneously.

#### Turns

The referee will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs. At the start of combat, each PC must make a save to act before their opponents. For a physical combat that should be a BIO test, for the Infosphere - a PSY test.

> **Example:** *Bea has accidentally stumbled upon an area where a gang of smugglers is prowling. In order to act before them, she has to take a BIO test. She fails, so the smugglers attack first.*

#### Attacking & Damage

The attacker rolls the **damage dice** for their weapon. For physical damage (inflicted in the BIO) subtracts the **armour** of the target, then deals the remaining damage to the **opponent’s HP**.

**Unarmed** attacks always deal **1d4** damage.

If the amount of the damage exceeds the opponent's current HP, the remaining points **decrease the corresponding ability** of the character (BIO for combat in the physical world, INF for clash in the Infosphere or EMP weapons).

Reducing any of the character's abilities to zero means:

- BIO - physical death of the character
- PSY - catatonia and, after a potential cure, serious mental problems (phobias, anxiety) requiring specialist care or social problems (permanent exclusion from certain societies)
- INF - blocked access to the Infosphere and failure of all cybermodifications until at least one point of this ability has been regained

#### Multiple Attackers

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll **all** damage dice and keep the single **highest** result.

#### Attack Modifiers

If fighting from a **position of weakness** (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll **1d4** damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of **advantage** (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll **1d12** damage instead of their normal die.

If the 1d4/1d12 modification is insufficient for your style of play, you can define a **imparing/enhancing level** of attack calculated as the **number of dice types** by which you reduce/increase the attack. The level of imparing/enhancing is determined by the referee depending on the circumstances.

The available damage dice are: `d4, d6, d8, d10, d12`. In this case, the imparing/enhancing level is a value between `-4` and `4`.

> Example:
> John jumps behind the crates to take cover from the guards' fire. The crates are metal so the referee decides that they provide good enough cover to weaken the attacks by 2. In this case the guard who had a d12 damage rolls d8. The other guard fired a d6 pistol, a weakening by 2 admittedly is off the scale but cannot give a dice less than the minimum, so the shot is settled with a d4 dice.

#### Dual Weapons

If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll **both** damage dice and keep the **single highest** result.

#### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

#### Critical Damage

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s ability (BIO or INF) by the amount remaining.
They must then make a BIO/INF save (with the ability value after reduction) to avoid **critical damage**.
Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers BIO critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, hanging on to life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

Any PC that suffers INF critical damage, becomes immobilised in the Infosphere (cannot move between nodes) or all its cyber modifications temporarily cease to function if it operates in the physical world.

The **Black ICE** and **EMP weapons** have an additional critical damage effect: *"if the target has a neuroprocessor, inflict as many points of damage to the target's PSY as have been inflicted to INF this turn"*.

#### Armor

If you are fighting in the physical world, before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than **3 Armor**.

#### Retreat

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful save (BIO for physical world, INF for the Infosphere), as well as a safe destination to run to.

#### Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 BIO, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are [impaired](#attack-modifiers) (excluding [blast](#blast) damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are [enhanced](#attack-modifiers) and deal [blast](#blast) damage.

#### Morale

Enemies must pass a **PSY** save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their **leader’s PSY** in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

#### Healing

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed.

Lost BIO or PSY points can usually be restored by a week's rest supported by medical systems or an appropriate specialist.

Lost INF points require a visit to a cybertechnician or self-repair if possible.

**Calibration**: If a character's INF is **zero**, the character can self-calibrate the interface by recovering **one** point of INF. Calibration requires a secure location and takes approximately one hour.

### Economy

The global currency in the game is **credit** denoted by **ℂ**.

Characters start the game with a pool of **1d4 * 1000** credits.

All basic products and services such as food, household appliances, simple tools, etc. are offered as a monthly subscription with different levels. The differences are primarily in the quality of these items and not in their type.
In shops, products are labelled with a coloured sticker symbolising the subscription level so that the customer knows which products to put in the shopping basket.
Exceptions to this subscription system are specialised services and equipment:

- arms and armour
- vehicles and drones
- specialised laboratory, military, construction equipment
- engineering, research, security, medical, repair services

Some of the exceptions above have their own separate price lists and others depend on the specific need and offer - they will therefore be negotiated between player characters and NPCs.
Any equipment officially considered illegal requires appropriate contacts and can be at any price.

For a detailed list of products and services and their prices, see  [Appendix](./economy.md).

### Infosphere

The **Infosphere** is a global computer network that connects almost all devices and systems serving humans. Individual clusters of data are referred as nodes and represented like the equivalent of 'places' in the physical world.

Each character is able to interact with the network using an avatar representing the character. Connecting to the network is common and requires no special equipment.

It is possible to block access to the Infosphere although any device that does this is officially **illegal**.

Each character can perform a certain set of standard activities in the Infosphere:

- searching for information
- contacting people with known addresses or public places
- obtaining public information
- accessing the products and services offered by Infosphere

All other activities such as hacking, security, access to proprietary information require a cybermodification referred to as a **neuroprocessor**.

**Infosphere actions** are resolved similarly to the physical world, except that the ability taken into account for saves is Interface. Similarly, when a character's HP is reduced to zero, the ability that is decreased by attacks is Interface instead of Biology.

**Lock**: Reducing a character's INF to zero means that they cannot use the Infosphere until they have regained at least one point of this ability.

**Hacking**: Network nodes can have an HP level and an INF level specified. To access such a node (without the owner's permission), the player must reduce its HP to zero.  In order to do so, it is required to carry out attacks using the neuroprocessor. Once the HP is removed, the player takes control of the node for **as many rounds** as his **INF level**.

**Data destruction**: After reducing the node's HP to zero, the player can still perform the attack but this time will reduce the node's INF. Reducing a node's **INF to zero** means irrevocably **destroying the data or program** (unless its owner had a backup). Reducing a node's INF to values other than zero has no effect on the game.

**Firewall**: Player characters can also actively protect Infosphere nodes. To do so, they must have the neuroprocessor and pass an INF test. Success means that this node is completely immune to hacking in the next turn.

**Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics (ICE)**: Infosphere nodes can have automatic defense systems. This means they have an additional **ICE** factor expressed in **damage dice** (d4 to d12). Each round of hacking they make an attack on a character, reducing hacker's HP and INF. Hackers recognize the 'white' and 'black' ICE.

**Black ICE** (officially illegal), has an additional feature:
- *Critical Damage*: inflict the same amount of damage to PSY that was inflicted to INF this turn.

**Software**: any character with a neuroprocessor can use an **infodeck** (takes up one space in the inventory) to store **programs**. Programs can assist the player with hacking or defending nodes, but require **activation**.  The infodeck can store any number of programs.

**Software Activation**: In order to use the functions of the software stored on the infodeck, the character must activate the software. This procedure does not require any resources but counts as an **action in the round**. The maximum number of activated programs a hacker can have is equal to **the current INF level divided by 3** (round up). One action is sufficient to activate all available programs at any given time. It takes one action to swap any number of active programs for another.
If a character's INF changes and some programs were activated, adjust the amount of activated software to the current INF.

**Software creation**: similar to cybermodifications, players can create their own software freely describing its effects and matching them to the game mechanics.

| Software type     | Effect                                                       |       Price        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------: |
| Computing booster | +1 HP for resolving Infosphere attack                        |        1000        |
| Shield            | +1 Armor for resolving Infosphere attack                     |       10000        |
| Neural booster    | +1 INF for Infosphere tests                                  |        7000        |
| Icebreaker        | Extra damage when hacking                                    | damage dice * 1500 |
| Battle virus      | Critical damage that inflicts additional injuries            | damage dice * 500  |
| Mutagenic virus   | Critical damage that does not injure the target              |        1500        |
| Utility           | Additional functionality that does not modify game mechanics |        1000        |

### Cybermodifications

Each character may install cybermodifications in an amount not exceeding the **actual** level of the **Interface ability divided by 3** (rounding up).

> Example: *John Kowalsky* has Interface ability equal to 10. This means that he can install 4 cyber modifications.

A character whose **INF is zero** cannot use cybermodifications - they stop working until the character has regained at least one point of Interface.

**Activation**: any cybernetic modification item that affects game mechanics (modifiers to saves, critical damage) requires **activation** every time the character wishes to use it. Activation requires marking **one point of Fatigue** in the inventory.
Cybermodification items not marked as requiring activation have a permanent effect and their use does not increase a character's Fatigue.

**Cyberpsychosis**: cyber modifications can have a negative impact on the human body. Intense use of implants can take a toll on a character's mental condition. Whenever fatigue fills a character's **entire** inventory, **subtract one** from their **PSY**.

For more information on the creation of cybermodifications and their pricing, see [Appendix](./cybermod.md).

### Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the referee may roll **2d6** and consult the following table:

|    2    |  3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11  |   12    |
| :-----: | :---: | :-----: | :---: | :-----: |
| Hostile | Wary  | Curious | Kind  | Helpful |

### Die of Fate

Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the weather, unique character knowledge, etc.).
In these situations, roll **1d6**.

- A roll of **4 or more** generally **favors** the players.
- A roll of **3 or under** tends to mean **bad luck** for the PCs or their allies.

Before the roll, it is useful to clearly describe to the players both the favourable and unfavourable effects of the roll.

## Character development

In *Cyber* we do not use the concept of character level or the idea of experience points. However, this does not mean that characters will not be subject to change during subsequent sessions.

### Fiction

The fundamental concept of development in *Cyber* is to change a character in the game world. This change doesn't necessarily mean that the character becomes stronger, smarter or more resilient (unfortunately!), so we don't focus on the mechanics of raising character abilities. Instead, the changes that occur in our hero or heroine will be the result of events in the fictional world, the decisions the character makes and the adventures he or she will take part in.

### Technological improvements

One of the characteristic features of the cyberpunk trend is the use of technology to enhance human abilities. For players who are comfortable with character ability boosting mechanisms, this is another option to exploit.

Cyber modifications are limited only by the imagination of the players and can change literally every mechanical element of the game: character abilities, types of saves, damage dice, HP level or equipment capacity.
In this way, a character can be changed at will; it becomes just a matter of money and the availability of the technologies in question.

## NPCs

### Hirelings

PCs can hire hirelings to aid them in their expeditions. To create a hireling, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 HP and a simple weapon (d6).
Hirelings do not have their own cybermodifications but the player can equip them at his own expense if he wishes.

The average **monthly cost** of a mercenary, is **100 * his best ability level**.

### Making NPCs

Use the following template to model any more sophisticated NPC:

**Name**  
X HP, X Armor, X BIO, X PSY, X INF, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)

- Description of appearance, behaviour, goals and desires
- A trait, tactic or peculiarity that makes the character unique
- Special equipment

#### General Principles

Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.

Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious threats get 10+ HP.
Use flavor and style to help them stand out.
Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
Remember that HP is Hit Protection , not Hit Points. It’s a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.
