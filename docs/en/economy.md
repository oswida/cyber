# Products and services

Products and services are purchased using a global currency known as **credit** ( **â„‚** ).

In *Cyber*, however, players will not read hefty price lists or analyze hundreds of tables. In a global world, everyday products are also provided by corporations.

All **basic products and services** such as food, simple tools, etc. are offered in the form of a monthly **subscription** of varying levels. The differences are primarily in the quality of these items rather than their type.
In shops, products are marked with a coloured sticker symbolising the subscription level so that the customer knows which products to put in the basket.

Each subscription offers items that have a certain probability of being damaged (food may be stale). Before or after each use of the item (the choice is up to the players), roll **1d6**, results of **1,2,3** (depending on the subscription) may indicate that the item has been damaged or the service has been performed unreliably. The character can of course obtain the item or service again but it will take time.

Exceptions to this subscription system are  specialised services and equipment:

- arms and armour
- vehicles and drones
- specialised laboratory, military, construction equipment
- engineering, research, security services


Some of items above have their own separate price lists and others depend on the specific need and offer - they will therefore be negotiated between player characters and NPCs.
Any equipment that is officially considered illegal requires appropriate contacts and can be at any price.
