# Background

Background summarises a character's past life experience and gives them a certain starting status.
It is not equivalent to a class, it does not define the character's path of development. It only describes the character's **past experiences** and resulting knowledge or status. Additionally, the player may (but does not have to) choose or draw a reason for giving up their previous lifestyle.

Backgrounds proposed below represent 'ordinary' people rather than trained professionals, but don't let that fool you. These people are not ordinary - they have left familiar environments and dared to take a step into the unknown. Dared to change their lives. They are determined and dangerous. They believe that somewhere out there, in the future, a better fate awaits them and they intend to find out. No matter what price they have to pay...

In addition, to mechanically reflect a character's past experience, each past determines a bonus to one of three abilities.
